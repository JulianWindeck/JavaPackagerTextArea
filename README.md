Javapackager Example
====================

The main purpose of this project is to be a relatively simple example
of using the `javapackager` command to build a Mac/Java application as
a traditional macOS application bundle.

To compile and run the project, run these commands:

- `./1compile.sh` — compiles the application
- `./2makeJar` — creates a jar file from the *.class files and manifest
- `./3build` - builds the Mac application bundle

Assuming that everything works as it should, you can then run the 
newly-built application using this command:

- `open release/bundles/MacJavaProperties.app/`
